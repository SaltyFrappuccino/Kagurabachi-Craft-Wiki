# Flame Bone Sorcery

Flame Bone is an innate Sorcery, not tied to any known Enchanted Blade. It is a raw and destructive art that allows the user to manifest and control superheated bones, unleashing them in devastating fiery attacks.

## Core Mechanic: Summoning the Bone

Unlike other Sorceries, most Flame Bone abilities require you to be physically holding the **Flame Bone**. You must first use the "Summon Flame Bone" ability to manifest it in your main hand. Using the ability again will cause the bone to dissipate.
