# Isou Sorcery

Isou is an innate Sorcery, not tied to any known Enchanted Blade. It is a raw and destructive art that allows the user to manipulate kinetic force and create powerful, concussive blasts that shatter the very ground.

Unlike other Sorceries that may rely on summoned entities or complex resources, Isou is a direct application of the user's will and **Spiritual Energy (SE)**, making it a pure test of a sorcerer's power reserves.
