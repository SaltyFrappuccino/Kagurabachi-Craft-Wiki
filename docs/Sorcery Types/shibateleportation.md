# Shiba Teleportation Sorcery

Shiba Teleportation is a rare, innate Sorcery focused on absolute control over the battlefield through tactical repositioning. Users of this art can teleport themselves, allies, and even enemies to gain a decisive advantage in combat.

## Core Mechanic: Marks and Mass Teleport

This Sorcery features two unique supportive abilities for setting "marks"—one for a location and one for an entity—allowing you to return to them at a moment's notice. Additionally, its special ability is a toggleable mode that enhances your other teleports.
