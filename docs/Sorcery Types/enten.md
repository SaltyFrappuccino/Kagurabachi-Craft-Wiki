# Enten Sorcery

The Enten Sorcery is the signature power of the seventh Enchanted Blade, **Enten**. This art revolves around creating and manipulating "Kuro"â€”sentient, goldfish-like constructs of pure dark energy.

To use this Sorcery, you must have the Enten blade in your inventory.

## The Kuro Fish System

The primary resource for Enten, besides your own Spiritual Energy, is **Kuro Fish**. These fish are summoned using a supportive ability and will follow you around. Your other, more powerful abilities will consume these fish as fuel. The number of active fish you have is displayed via a counter.
