# Welcome to the Kagurabachi Craft Wiki!

**Kagurabachi Craft** is a combat and magic overhaul mod for Minecraft, inspired by the dark and action-packed world of the *Kagurabachi* manga. This mod transforms the vanilla combat experience into a dynamic, skill-based system and introduces a deep Sorcery system based on the legendary Enchanted Blades.

Prepare to master new fighting styles, awaken your latent Spiritual Energy, and choose your path in a world where powerful sorcerers and deadly blades clash.

## Getting Started: The Awakening

Your journey does not begin at a crafting table. To tap into the world of Spiritual Energy, you must first face true despair.

When you are on the brink of death in battle for the first time, there is a chance your latent power will awaken. This "Awakening" event is your entry point into the mod's core progression. You will gain your first level of **Spiritual Energy Mastery**, granting you access to the foundational mechanics of the mod.
