# The Enchanted Blades

The Enchanted Blades are six legendary katanas forged during a great war, each imbued with immense, world-altering power. It is said a secret seventh blade was also forged in the aftermath.

These blades are the ultimate goal for any warrior or sorcerer. Wielding one is not a simple matter of picking it up; it requires you to form a binding contract with the blade itself, granting you access to its unique and devastating **Sorcery**.

## The Blade Contract

When you acquire an Enchanted Blade, you don't just wield it; you form a contract with it. This is a powerful bond that links the blade's power directly to you.

### Forming a Contract
The first time you hold an unowned Enchanted Blade in your main hand, a contract is automatically forged.
- The blade becomes attuned to you, storing your unique signature.
- You are immediately granted the blade's corresponding Sorcery Type (e.g., holding Enten grants you Enten Sorcery).
- A message will appear, confirming the contract, and you will hear a powerful sound as the bond settles.

### Breaking a Contract
This powerful bond is also fragile. By default, if you die while under contract with a blade, the contract is severed.
- The blade loses its owner and becomes unowned again, ready for a new user to form a contract.
- You lose access to its Sorcery and will revert to your previous Sorcery Type (or none).
- A message will notify you that your contract has been broken.

However, this behavior can be changed. Server administrators or players in single-player worlds can use the game rule `/gamerule kbc_keep_enchanted_blades_contract_after_death true` to disable this feature, allowing you to keep your contract even after death.

## Enten (淵天)

The "Abyssal Heaven" is the secret seventh Enchanted Blade. Its power is not derived from common elements but from a unique darkness, manifesting as ink-like energy.

- **Sorcery:** Forming a contract with Enten is the key to unlocking the **[Enten Sorcery](sorcery/enten.md)**. Without this bond, you cannot access its powerful abilities.
- **Acquisition:** The method of obtaining this blade is a closely guarded secret, a journey that a player must discover for themselves.
